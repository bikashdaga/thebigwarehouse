# The Big Box of VCS
This box contains a bunch of resources that are related to version control systems like git and SVN.

## Git
 - [First Aid Git](http://ricardofilipe.com/projects/firstaidgit/#/) - Searchable FAQ. Has questions like "How do I do x?"
 - [git-hub](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-hub) - Augment your git installation with the `hub` subcommand that lets you interact with the GitHub REST api
 - [The BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) - A fantastic tool to remove things like large files and other secrets from your git commit history. Much faster and simpler to use that `git filter-branch`.
