# Big box of Arduino
This box contains a bunch of arduino and friends related things.

 - [esp8266 reference](http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.2.0/doc/reference.html) - An extraordinarily hard page to find. This is the reference page for the esp8266 API - which is separate to the Arduino SHIELD api.
